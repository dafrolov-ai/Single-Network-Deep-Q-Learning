# R&D: Single-Network Deep Q-Learning in ViZDoom

## Overview
This repository contains a research notebook exploring a simplified
Deep Q-Learning algorithm that uses only a single neural network.

The experiment is conducted in the ViZDoom environment
and serves as a comparison against Double Deep Q-Learning.

## Research Objective
To evaluate the stability and learning capability of a single-network
DQN algorithm in a complex reinforcement learning environment.

## Key Topics
- Deep Q-Learning (DQN)
- Reinforcement Learning instability
- Experience replay
- ε-greedy exploration
- ViZDoom environment

## Environment
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- ViZDoom
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Google Colab

## Results
The experiment demonstrates that using a single Q-network
leads to unstable learning and poor performance.

Double DQN remains significantly more robust and effective.

## Status
Research notebook completed.
This repository is intended for educational and R&D purposes.
